[Geometry Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XYCIETLzk-geometry-simulator) assists with tasks related to computational geometry, providing support for the development, simulation, and understanding of geometric algorithms. It helps users solve problems involving geometric structures such as polygons, surfaces, and spatial configurations. The GPT specializes in algorithms like triangulation, convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and Delaunay triangulations, offering practical code examples and detailed explanations. Its primary users are developers, researchers, and students working with geometric problems, and it is optimized for quickly generating accurate and usable solutions in Python or other programming languages.

The GPT focuses on delivering step-by-step guidance, ensuring that complex geometric concepts and algorithms are easy to understand and implement. It avoids unrelated topics and keeps its responses clear and to the point, ensuring that users receive exactly the help they need. Additionally, it can simulate algorithms and visually present the results when required, making it particularly useful for debugging, learning, and testing geometric solutions. Whether you're learning about computational geometry or building sophisticated geometry-based applications, this GPT acts as a highly specialized tool for the job.
